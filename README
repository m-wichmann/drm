# drm - distributed russian mob

Distributed video transcoder based on HandBrake and Celery.


## Dependencies

Install all python requirements using pip:

  pip install -r requirements.txt

You also have to install Handbrake or rather HandBrakeCLI on all slaves.

  apt install handbrake-cli

The master needs to install a broker for celery. Currently only RabbitMQ is
supported and tested. You should configure a user for drm in RabbitMQ.

  apt install rabbitmq-server

The slave and the master need also to have the celery daemon installed:

  sudo apt install celeryd
  sudo service celeryd start

To rip DVD images, the following tools are used: dvdbackup, genisoimage.


## Deployment

1) Create the in and the out directory on the master. Copy the ISO files into
   the in directory.

2) Set all settings in the master.cfg (encoding settings and directories).

3) RabbitMQ configuration
  - Check if host configuration is ok: Host name set and entry for 127.0.0.1
    in hosts file.
  - Set up user and vhost in RabbitMQ:

        sudo rabbitmqctl add_user myuser mypassword
        sudo rabbitmqctl add_vhost myvhost
        sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p myvhost myuser ".*" ".*" ".*"

4) Set all settings on each of the slaves (ip address of the master and the
   user/password for rabbitmq e.g. "myuser"/"mypassword")

5) Start master with the command:

        ./drm.py --master master.cfg

6) Start each slave with the command:

        ./drm.py --slave slave.cfg
